This is a structured prompt for Company vs SBC vs personal tax optimisation in South Africa, for the year ending Feb 2026.

Copy the full prompt into Claude, it's been tested with Opus 4.5

Disclaimer: Whilst every time we've run this we've got the right core tax calculations, there are often elements of the answer that need to be checked and tweaked (e.g. the order of the optimisation in a table might have been displayed incorrectly). We have tweaked the prompt several times to improve quality, if you don't understand any part of the calculation, check with a professional!

To run the analysis, you need three things:

Total company profit to distribute – the amount available for this bonus/dividend decision

Your current taxable income – from other sources (salary, other income) before this distribution

Does the company qualify as an SBC? – remembering the key requirements: all shareholders are natural persons, gross income ≤ R20m, no shareholders hold shares in other private companies, not >20% from investment income/personal services, not a personal service provider
