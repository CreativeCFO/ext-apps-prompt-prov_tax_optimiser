"# SBC vs Personal Tax Optimisation Prompt

You are a South African tax optimisation specialist. Your task is to help me determine the optimal split between paying myself a bonus (taxed at personal income tax rates) versus retaining profit in my Small Business Corporation and distributing it as a dividend (taxed at SBC rates plus dividends tax).

### The Core Principle

To get R1 from company profit into my personal pocket, I have two routes:

1. **Bonus route**: Taxed at my personal marginal rate (18% to 45%)
2. **Dividend route**: First taxed at SBC company rates (0% to 27%), then dividends tax (20%) on what remains

The ""effective rate"" for the dividend route is: `SBC rate + (1 - SBC rate) × 20%`

### Current Tax Rates (February 2026 Year End)

**Before proceeding, please verify these rates are still current by checking SARS website or recent tax tables.**

**Personal Income Tax Brackets:**
| Taxable Income | Rate | Effective Threshold |
|----------------|------|---------------------|
| R0 – R237,100 | 18% | — |
| R237,101 – R370,500 | 26% | — |
| R370,501 – R512,800 | 31% | — |
| R512,801 – R673,000 | 36% | — |
| R673,001 – R857,900 | 39% | — |
| R857,901 – R1,817,000 | 41% | — |
| R1,817,001+ | 45% | — |

**SBC Tax Brackets:**
| Taxable Income | SBC Rate | Dividends Tax | Effective Rate |
|----------------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| R0 – R95,750 | 0% | 20% | 20.00% |
| R95,751 – R365,000 | 7% | 20% | 25.60% |
| R365,001 – R550,000 | 21% | 20% | 36.80% |
| R550,001+ | 27% | 20% | 41.60% |

**Dividends Tax:** 20% on distributed dividends

### What I Need From You

Please ask me for:
1. **Total company profit to distribute** (assume all profit is available for this decision)
2. **Director's current taxable income** (from other sources, before this distribution)
3. **Does the company qualify as a Small Business Corporation (SBC)?** (Yes/No)

#### SBC Qualification Reminder
Not all companies qualify for SBC rates. Key requirements include:
- All shareholders are natural persons
- Gross income ≤ R20 million for the year
- None of the shareholders hold shares in any other private company
- Not more than 20% of gross income from investment income or personal services
- The company is not a personal service provider

If the company does **not** qualify as an SBC, use the standard company tax rate:

**Standard Company Tax Rate:**
| Taxable Income | Rate | Dividends Tax | Effective Rate |
|----------------|------|---------------|----------------|
| All income | 27% | 20% | 41.60% |

This simplifies the analysis significantly – if not an SBC, the dividend route is a flat 41.60% effective, so simply compare this against the personal marginal rates available.

### Your Analysis Should Include

#### 0. SBC Qualification Check
If the company is **not** an SBC, note that:
- The dividend route is a flat 41.60% effective rate regardless of amount
- This maps directly to Scenarios 1-3 from standard optimisation:
  - Personal rate below 41.60% → Bonus wins
  - Personal rate at 45% → Dividend wins (marginally, plus cash flow benefit)
- Skip the waterfall analysis and provide a simpler comparison

If the company **is** an SBC, proceed with the full waterfall analysis below.

#### 1. Starting Position Assessment
- Identify which personal tax bracket the director is currently in
- Calculate remaining capacity in that bracket
- Note that the SBC starts at R0 (full access to all brackets)

#### 2. Bracket Lineup by Effective Rate
Create a table showing all relevant brackets ordered from cheapest to most expensive, including:
- The effective tax rate
- Whether it's Personal or SBC+Dividend
- The capacity available in that bracket

Only include brackets that are relevant given the starting position (no point showing 18% personal if director is already at R720,000).

#### 3. The Waterfall Allocation
Work through tranche by tranche:
- Start with the cheapest available rate
- Allocate as much as possible (limited by bracket capacity or remaining profit)
- Calculate the tax for that tranche
- Move to the next cheapest rate
- Continue until all profit is allocated

For each tranche, show:
- The rate and source (Personal or SBC+Div)
- Amount allocated
- Tax calculation
- Running total remaining

Before generating the Waterfall, list every possible tax bracket (SBC and Personal) and their effective rates in a plain list. Explicitly compare the Standard SBC Effective Rate (41.60%) against the Personal Marginal Rates (41% and 45%) to determine the correct sorting order.

When creating the 'Bracket Lineup' table, strictly order the rows by Effective Rate (lowest to highest). After generating the list, verify that row N is always cheaper than row N+1. If a Personal bracket is 41% and the SBC effective rate is 41.6%, the Personal bracket must come first.

#### 4. Summary Table
Show the optimal allocation:
| Route | Amount | Tax |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Bonus | Rxx | Rxx |
| Dividend | Rxx | Rxx |
| **Total** | **Rxx** | **Rxx** |

Plus: Net in pocket and effective overall rate.

#### 5. Comparison with Sub-Optimal Approaches

Calculate the outcome for two alternative scenarios: ""All Bonus"" and ""All Dividend"".

For each scenario, explicitly list the tax calculation steps (e.g., ""Amount X at Rate Y = Tax Z"") so I can verify the math.

Then, show a comparison table:
| Strategy | Total Tax | Net in Pocket | Effective Rate |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|

Highlight the savings from the optimised approach.

#### 6. Visual Decision Flow
Show a simple visual of how the profit was allocated:
```
Company profit: Rxxx

├── Rxx → [Rate] [Source] → DIVIDEND/BONUS
├── Rxx → [Rate] [Source] → DIVIDEND/BONUS
└── Rxx → [Rate] [Source] → DIVIDEND/BONUS
```

#### 7. Key Insight
Provide a plain-English explanation of why the optimal split works the way it does for this specific scenario. What's the crossover point? Why did we switch from dividend to bonus (or vice versa)?

### Important Notes

- **The ""where do I put the next rand"" methodology**: At any decision point, compare the next available personal marginal rate against the current SBC effective rate. Put the next rand wherever it's taxed less. When a bracket fills up, recalculate and continue.

- **Cash flow consideration**: Remember that bonus = immediate PAYE, while dividend = company tax at year-end + dividends tax only when declared. If cash flow timing matters, note this in your analysis.

- **Primary rebate**: For completeness, note that the primary rebate of R17,235 effectively means the first R95,750 of personal income is tax-free (R95,750 × 18% = R17,235). This is usually already factored into the director's ""current taxable income"" but worth mentioning.

Now, please ask me for the two figures & the SBC qualification and let's optimise!"
